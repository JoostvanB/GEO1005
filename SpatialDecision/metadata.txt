name=GeoCharge Planner
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=The planner uses this app to determine the best location for additional charging spots in the future. The app needs data from a navigation app (for example PlugShare) as an input. The planner sees a map with the places where people want to go and the amount of available charging spots (see example picture of application screen below). The planner can see several layers to identify the critical spots to help him decide where to put new charging stations.
